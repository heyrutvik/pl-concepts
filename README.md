# PL Concepts
Notes and Exercises from the book ["Programming Language Concepts"](https://www.itu.dk/~sestoft/plc/) by Peter Sestoft.

Book uses [F#](https://fsharp.org/) as a meta language but this repo uses [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) as a meta language.
Most of the examples of the book are also ported to Scala.
